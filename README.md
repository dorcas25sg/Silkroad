# Week 8: Assignment

## Due: March 15

Choose one of the javascript libraries below. You'll want to
spend some time exploring the API or documentation. Search
online for example of it in use. Try it outâ€”we want you to find
an exciting or useful feature. 

Your task is to make something using the library of your choice.
You can enhance your midterm or a homework or lab assignment with
the library, or you can build a new visualization or demo that
showcases a facet of your library. 

This is meant to be a creative, self-directed mini project. We
are expecting you to spend one or two hours on it.
